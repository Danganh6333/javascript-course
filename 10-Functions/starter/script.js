 /**
  *  JavaScript does not have passing by reference,
  * only passing by value,even though it looks like it's passing by reference
  * 
  * There are languages like C++, where you can pass a reference to any value,
  * instead of the value itself.This works even with primitives,
  * so you could pass a reference to the value of five,
  * and then the original value, outside of the function, would be changed.
  * And this is called pass by reference.
  * 
  * Once again, JavaScript does not have pass by reference.And I know it's confusing, because as we just learned,
  * for objects, we do in fact pass in a reference.
  * So the memory address of the object.However, that reference itself is still a value.
  * It's simply a value that contains a memory address.So basically we pass a reference to the function,
  * but we do not pass by reference,and this is an important distinction.

//First-Class and Higher-Order Functions

 /**
  * ### Summary: First-Class and Higher-Order Functions in JavaScript

**First-Class Functions:**
- **Definition:** JavaScript has first-class functions, meaning that functions are treated as values. This concept allows functions to be stored in variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.
- **Why:** Functions in JavaScript are considered objects, and since objects are values, functions are too.
- **Applications:** 
  - Storing functions in variables or object properties.
  - Passing functions as arguments to other functions (e.g., callback functions in event listeners).
  - Returning functions from other functions.

**Higher-Order Functions:**
- **Definition:** A higher-order function is one that either receives another function as an argument or returns a new function.
- **Examples:**
  - **Receiving a Function:** In an event listener, the `addEventListener` function is a higher-order function because it takes another function (e.g., `greet`) as an argument.
  - **Returning a Function:** A higher-order function can also return a new function, which is a more advanced but common technique in JavaScript.

**Key Distinction:**
- **First-Class vs. Higher-Order:** 
  - **First-Class Functions:** A concept indicating that functions are values.
  - **Higher-Order Functions:** Practical implementations that are made possible by the first-class function concept.

**Conclusion:**
- Understanding these concepts is crucial for mastering JavaScript, as first-class functions enable the use of higher-order functions, a powerful tool in the language.

   //functions have methods and even have properties. And one of them is the name property.

//The bind Method

 //Just like the call  method, bind also allows us to manually set this keywords for any function call. The difference is that bind does not immediately call the function. Instead it returns a new function where this keyword is bound.

  * Key Differences Between call, apply, and bind
  call and apply: These methods are used when you want to immediately invoke the function with a specific this value. The difference between them is how you pass the arguments (individually with call or as an array with apply).

  bind: This method is used when you want to create a new function with a specific this value, but you don't want to call the function immediately. The new function can be called later, and this will always refer to the value you provided to bind.

 /* 
 Let's build a simple poll app!

 A poll has a question, an array of options from which people can choose, and an array with the number of replies for each option. This data is stored in the starter object below.

  Here are your tasks:

  1. Create a method called 'registerNewAnswer' on the 'poll' object. The method does 2 things:
  1.1. Display a prompt window for the user to input the number of the selected option. The prompt should look like this:
        What is your favourite programming language?
        0: JavaScript
        1: Python
        2: Rust
        3: C++
        (Write option number)
  
  1.2. Based on the input number, update the answers array. For example, if the option is 3, increase the value AT POSITION 3 of the array by 1. Make sure to check if the input is a number and if the number makes sense (e.g answer 52 wouldn't make sense, right?)
  2. Call this method whenever the user clicks the "Answer poll" button.
  3. Create a method 'displayResults' which displays the poll results. The method takes a string as an input (called 'type'), which can be either 'string' or 'array'. If type is 'array', simply display the results array as it is, using console.log(). This should be the default option. If type is 'string', display a string like "Poll results are 13, 2, 4, 1". 
  4. Run the 'displayResults' method at the end of each 'registerNewAnswer' method call.

  HINT: Use many of the tools you learned about in this and the last section ðŸ˜‰

  BONUS: Use the 'displayResults' method to display the 2 arrays in the test data. Use both the 'array' and the 'string' option. Do NOT put the arrays in the poll object! So what shoud the this keyword look like in this situation?

  BONUS TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 3]
  BONUS TEST DATA 2: [1, 5, 3, 9, 6, 1]

  GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

  const poll = {
    question: 'What is your favourite programming language?',
    options: ['0: JavaScript', '1: Python', '2: Rust', '3: C++'],
    answers: new Array(4).fill(0),
    registerNewAnswer(){
      //Create prompt
      const answer = Number( prompt(`${this.question}\n ${this.options.join('\n')}\n(Write option number)`)) //Transform array into a string
      console.log(answer);
    //Register the answer
    //Check if the value is actually a number and if the answer is below the length of the array like if the answer is 10, then that doesn't make any sense.
      typeof answer === 'number' && answer < this.answer.length && this.answer[answer]++ // if the option is 3, increase the value AT POSITION 3 of the array by 1
    },  
  };
