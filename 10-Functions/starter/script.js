  *  JavaScript does not have passing by reference,

  * so you could pass a reference to the value of five,
  * and then the original value, outside of the function, would be changed.
  * And this is called pass by reference.
  * 
  * Once again, JavaScript does not have pass by reference.And I know it's confusing, because as we just learned,
  * for objects, we do in fact pass in a reference.
  * So the memory address of the object.However, that reference itself is still a value.
  * It's simply a value that contains a memory address.So basically we pass a reference to the function,

//First-Class and Higher-Order Functions

 /**
  * ### Summary: First-Class and Higher-Order Functions in JavaScript

**First-Class Functions:**
- **Definition:** JavaScript has first-class functions, meaning that functions are treated as values. This concept allows functions to be stored in variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.
- **Why:** Functions in JavaScript are considered objects, and since objects are values, functions are too.
- **Applications:** 
  - Storing functions in variables or object properties.
  - Passing functions as arguments to other functions (e.g., callback functions in event listeners).
  - Returning functions from other functions.

**Higher-Order Functions:**
- **Definition:** A higher-order function is one that either receives another function as an argument or returns a new function.
- **Examples:**
  - **Receiving a Function:** In an event listener, the `addEventListener` function is a higher-order function because it takes another function (e.g., `greet`) as an argument.
  - **Returning a Function:** A higher-order function can also return a new function, which is a more advanced but common technique in JavaScript.

**Key Distinction:**
- **First-Class vs. Higher-Order:** 
  - **First-Class Functions:** A concept indicating that functions are values.
  - **Higher-Order Functions:** Practical implementations that are made possible by the first-class function concept.

**Conclusion:**
- Understanding these concepts is crucial for mastering JavaScript, as first-class functions enable the use of higher-order functions, a powerful tool in the language.

//Coding Challenge #1

 /* 
 Let's build a simple poll app!

 A poll has a question, an array of options from which people can choose, and an array with the number of replies for each option. This data is stored in the starter object below.

  Here are your tasks:

  1. Create a method called 'registerNewAnswer' on the 'poll' object. The method does 2 things:
  1.1. Display a prompt window for the user to input the number of the selected option. The prompt should look like this:
        What is your favourite programming language?
        0: JavaScript
        1: Python
        2: Rust
        3: C++
        (Write option number)
  
  1.2. Based on the input number, update the answers array. For example, if the option is 3, increase the value AT POSITION 3 of the array by 1. Make sure to check if the input is a number and if the number makes sense (e.g answer 52 wouldn't make sense, right?)
  2. Call this method whenever the user clicks the "Answer poll" button.
  3. Create a method 'displayResults' which displays the poll results. The method takes a string as an input (called 'type'), which can be either 'string' or 'array'. If type is 'array', simply display the results array as it is, using console.log(). This should be the default option. If type is 'string', display a string like "Poll results are 13, 2, 4, 1". 
  4. Run the 'displayResults' method at the end of each 'registerNewAnswer' method call.

  HINT: Use many of the tools you learned about in this and the last section ðŸ˜‰

  BONUS: Use the 'displayResults' method to display the 2 arrays in the test data. Use both the 'array' and the 'string' option. Do NOT put the arrays in the poll object! So what shoud the this keyword look like in this situation?

  BONUS TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 3]
  BONUS TEST DATA 2: [1, 5, 3, 9, 6, 1]

  GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

      //Create prompt
      const answer = Number( prompt(`${this.question}\n ${this.options.join('\n')}\n(Write option number)`)) //Transform array into a string
      console.log(answer);
    //Register the answer
    //Check if the value is actually a number and if the answer is below the length of the array like if the answer is 10, then that doesn't make any sense.
      typeof answer === 'number' && answer < this.answers.length && this.answers[answer]++ // if the option is 3, increase the value AT POSITION 3 of the array by 1

   * The bonus part of the challenge is asking you to use the displayResults method to display results from two test arrays ([5, 2, 3] and [1, 5, 3, 9, 6, 1]).

//Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

  }
  runOnce();//This is not one time use because we can actually run this function again.

 //We can trick  JavaScript into thinking that this is just an expression. And we do that by simply wrapping all of this into parentheses. And so now, we basically transformed the statement that we had before into an expression

 })();//Calling by adding the ()

 //Using the arrow
 (() =>  console.log('This will never run again'))()


 //Immediately Invoked Function Expressions are not that used anymore. Because if all we want is to create a new scope for data privacy. All we need to do, is to just create a block like this

 /**
  * ### Summary of Closure Concept:

A **closure** is a powerful feature in JavaScript that allows a function to remember and access variables from its lexical scope, even after the function that created those variables has finished executing. This means that a function can "close over" the environment in which it was created, retaining access to variables that should technically no longer be available once the function's execution context is gone.

### Explanation with Example:

Consider the following code:

```javascript
const secureBooking = function () {
  let passengerCount = 0;

  return function() {
    passengerCount++;
    console.log(`${passengerCount} passenger`);
  };
};

const booker = secureBooking();
//booker function is able to increment the passengerCount to one, then to two and then to three.
//How can the Booker function update the passengerCount variable that's defined in the secure booking function that actually has already finished executing

that actually has already finished executing.
booker();//Log out 1 passengers
booker();//Log out 2 passengers
booker()://Log out 3 passengers
```

1. **Function Creation**: The `secureBooking` function defines a variable `passengerCount` and returns an inner function that increments and logs `passengerCount` whenever it is called.

2. **Calling the Function**: When `secureBooking` is called and assigned to `booker`, the inner function is returned and stored in `booker`.

3. **Closure in Action**: Even after `secureBooking` has finished executing and its execution context is removed from the call stack, the `booker` function still has access to `passengerCount`. This is because of the closure. The closure "remembers" the environment in which the `booker` function was created, so `booker` can still manipulate and access `passengerCount`.

### Key Points:

- **Closure Creation**: Closures are created automatically when a function is defined within another function and retains access to the parent functionâ€™s variables.
  
- **Persistent Environment**: The inner function retains access to variables from the outer functionâ€™s scope even after the outer function has completed execution.

- **No Manual Creation**: You don't manually create closures. They happen naturally in JavaScript whenever an inner function accesses variables from its outer function's scope.

- **Use Case**: Closures are widely used in JavaScript for things like data encapsulation, creating private variables, and in callback functions.

### Example Visualization:

Imagine the function is like a person carrying a backpack (closure) filled with variables. Even after the function's original environment (or home) is gone, it still carries that backpack around, allowing it to access those variables anywhere it goes.

### Final Note:

Closures are fundamental to understanding JavaScriptâ€™s behavior, especially in asynchronous programming and when working with callbacks. They allow functions to maintain access to their scope even after the context in which they were created has finished executing.
