  * ### Overview of Modern JavaScript Development

 **Modular Code Structure:**
 - In the past, JavaScript applications were written in one or multiple large scripts.
 - Today, projects are divided into multiple modules, making the code more organized and maintainable.
 - Modules allow for the inclusion of third-party modules or packages from the NPM repository (e.g., React, jQuery, Leaflet).

 **NPM (Node Package Manager):**
 - NPM is both a repository for packages and a command line tool for managing these packages.
 - Originally developed for Node.js, it has become the go-to repository for JavaScript packages.
 - NPM software is used to download, use, and share packages.

 **Build Process:**
 - After development, the project goes through a build process to create a final JavaScript bundle for production.
 - The build process typically includes two main steps:
  1. **Bundling:** Combines all modules into one file, eliminating unused code and compressing the code.Now this step is super important for two big reasons.
     First, older browsers don't support modules at all.And so code that's in a module could not be executed by any older browser.And second, it's also better for performance
  2. **Transpiling and Polyfilling:** Converts modern JavaScript syntax to ES5 using tools like Babel, ensuring compatibility with older browsers.

 **JavaScript Bundlers:**
 - Tools like webpack and Parcel are used to bundle and transform raw code into a final JavaScript bundle.
  - **Webpack:** Popular but requires extensive configuration.
  - **Parcel:** Zero configuration bundler that works out of the box, making it user-friendly.

 **Development Tools:**
 - Various tools are available on NPM, including live-server, Parcel, and Babel.
 - These tools help manage the development environment and ensure the code is ready for production.

 **Conclusion:**
 - Modern JavaScript development involves modular coding, package management with NPM, a build process for optimization, and the use of bundlers.
 - These practices are how professional developers write JavaScript today, and mastering them is a step towards becoming a professional developer.

 /**
  * ### Summary: Overview of Modules in JavaScript

**What Are Modules?**
- **Definition:** Modules are reusable pieces of code, usually stored in separate files. They encapsulate implementation details and provide a public API through exports.
- **Purpose:** Modules help organize code, improve maintainability, and allow for easy reuse and abstraction.

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Exports and Imports:**
   - **Exports:** Values, functions, or objects made available from a module. This forms the public API of the module.
   - **Imports:** Values or functions brought into a module from other modules. The importing module depends on the imported module.

2. **Benefits of Modules:**
   - **Composition:** Modules act as building blocks that can be combined to create complex applications.
   - **Isolation:** Modules can be developed independently, allowing for parallel work and reducing interdependencies.
   - **Abstraction:** Modules can hide implementation details, making code easier to manage and understand.
   - **Organization:** Breaking code into modules leads to a more structured and organized codebase.
   - **Reuse:** Modules can be reused across different projects or parts of a project.

**ES6 Modules vs. Traditional Scripts:**
1. **File Structure:**
   - **ES6 Modules:** Each file is a module, with top-level variables scoped to the module.
   - **Scripts:** Traditionally, scripts had global scope, leading to issues like namespace pollution.

2. **Strict Mode:**
   - **ES6 Modules:** Always run in strict mode by default.
   - **Scripts:** Typically run in sloppy mode unless explicitly set to strict mode.

3. **Import/Export Syntax:**
   - **ES6 Modules:** Support `import` and `export` syntax for linking modules.
   - **Scripts:** Do not support import/export, requiring manual or external methods for modularity.

4. **Execution:**
   - **ES6 Modules:** Imports and exports are hoisted to the top of the file, and modules are downloaded asynchronously.
   - **Scripts:** Executed synchronously by default, with imports/exports requiring workarounds.

**Behind the Scenes of Module Loading:**
1. **Parsing:** Imports are hoisted and resolved before execution.
2. **Downloading:** Modules are fetched asynchronously.
3. **Linking:** Exports and imports are connected, with imports acting as live references to exports.
4. **Execution:** Imported modules are executed first, followed by the main module.

**Conclusion:**
- Modules are a fundamental part of modern JavaScript development, providing structure, reusability, and efficiency. ES6 modules bring built-in support for these concepts, making code more modular and maintainable.
