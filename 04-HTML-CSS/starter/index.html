 <!-- The main element in all HTML documents is always the HTML element.  -->
<html>
 <!-- Then inside the HTML element we always have to head and the body. So let's write that head and body. -->
 <head>
    <!--whatever we put into this head here is basically like the settings of the page. So it's like describing the page.-->
    <title>Learning HTML & CSS</title> <!--title of the page-->
    <!-- We can write CSS right here in the HTML file using the style element. -->
    <!--Usually we write or CSS in an external CSS file.-->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> <!-- link does not create a clickable link -->
</head>
 <body>
    <!-- Whatever we put into the body is what's actually gonna be visible on the page -->
