//Handling an "Esc" Keypress Event

//There are three types of events for the keyboard(the key down,the key press,the key up)

 document.addEventListener('keydown',function(e){ //By using add event listener here on the document we are basically listening for events everywhere. So no matter where they happen on the page, they will always trigger the event handler that we're going to specify here.
    console.log('A key was pressed');
    console.log(e);//This will log out the event object and in this case, since it was a keyboard event we get information about which key was pressed. 
    console.log(e.key);

    if(e.key === 'Escape') {
      console.log('Esc was pressed')
      //when it does not contain the class hidden it means that it's visible
      if(!modal.classList.contains('hidden')){ //Checking if the modal dot class name contains the hidden class
         closeModal() //we do actually need to call this function. Because when this function here is executing so this one here as it reaches this line of course, something needs to happen.
      }
    };
   })
 //Anytime that an event occurs JavaScript generate an object. And that object contains all the information about the event itself, and we can then actually access that object in the event handler function.
