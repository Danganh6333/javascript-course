   * Objects don't have a well-defined order,so we can't reverse them.We're also not gonna reverse like undefined,or null or a Boolean
   * Then we can ask, what should we do if something else is passed in that is no string, number, or array? How are we gonna handle that?
   * what exactly should be returned from the function? should it always be a string,also we can start to ask more solution oriented questions,
   * like how to recognize whether the argument is a number,a string, or an array? Or how to actually it reverse a number,a string and an array.

   * to implement reversing a number, then implement reversing a string, and then implement reversing an array,
   * so that we are ready to deal whatever is passed into the function.Finally, we then also need of course to
