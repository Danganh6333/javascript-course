  /**
   * Mistake beginner make at learning how to code
   * Mistake 1 : Have no clear goal at the beginning of the journey
   * Mistake 2 : Blindly copy the code without caring how it works
   * Mistake 3 : Didn't reinforce what he was learning by doing small challenge or taking notes
   * Mistake 4 : Didn't practice coding and didn't come up with their own project ideas
   * Mistake 5 : Quickly became became frustrated whenever the code as not perfectly clean or efficient.
   * Mistake 6 : Lost motivation pretty quickly because they thought they could never know enough.
   * Mistake 7 : Learning in isolation without sharing their process

  /**
   * Fixing mistake 1 : 
   * Set a goal for yourself.Think about this and actually write it down on a paper or something, make this goal specific, measurable, realistic, and time-based.
   * Develop a plan on how to get there. It also helps to know exactly why you are learning to code and to be aware of the reason why you're doing this because 
   * this will help you stay motivated when learning becomes more and more difficult.To stay motivated, it's also great to imagine a big project that you want 
   * to be able to build by the end of your learning journey.With this project in mind, you just need to research the technologies
   */

  /**
   * Fixing mistake 2 : 
   * Instead of simply copying code from a course or tutorial, always make sure that you really understand the codes that you're learning and typing into your editor.
   * Don't move on if you don't understand.
   * Don't just copy and pasted from a tutorial or a site like Stack Overflow.

  /**
   * Fixing mistake 3 : 
   * Taking notes and by challenging yourself with small coding exercises and challenges.
   * Coming up with your own ideas like this and solving them,will absolutely boost your confidence in your programming skills
   * Take your time with this.There's absolutely no need to complete any courseas fast as possible

  /**
   *  Fixing mistake 4 : 
   *  Practicing on your own,is the single most important thing that you have to do.
   *  If you just follow courses and don't code on your own,you will never ever be able to write programs on your own.
   *  Come up with your own project ideas,no matter how small or big and just build them,or you can copy parts of popular sites or applications.
   *  Don't be stuck in tutorial hell, which is exactly the state of not being able to leave tutorials.
   *  Do not get stuck by trying to write a perfect code,which is really clean or really efficient but none of that matters in the beginning.
   */

  /**
   *  Fixing mistake 5 : 
   *  Embrace the fact that you will never know everything there is to know in web development.
   *  Do not compare yourself to top developers who do know a lot more than you,
   *  Nobody was born an expert and even experts are still learning all the time.
   */

  /**
   * Fixing mistake 6 : 
   * Learn together with other people, no matter if in person or online.
   * Whenever you learn something new, explain it to them because explaining things, forces you to really understand them first and repeating a concept will then really make it stick in your brain.
   * Share your goals publicly, or example, on a social network, to make yourself accountable.

   * Everthing is awesome -> Study course : understand code, take challenges and notes
